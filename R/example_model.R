#' Example model
#' 
#' A model for use in \pkg{rstanarm} examples. 
#' 
#' @name example_model
#' @format Calling \code{example("example_model")} will run the model in the 
#'   Examples section, below, and the resulting stanreg object will then be
#'   available in the global environment. The \code{chains} and \code{iter}
#'   arguments are specified to make this example be small in size. In practice,
#'   we recommend that they be left unspecified in order to use the default
#'   values (4 and 2000 respectively) or increased if there are convergence
#'   problems. The \code{cores} argument is optional and on a multicore system,
#'   the user may well want to set that equal to the number of chains being
#'   executed.
#'   
#' @seealso \code{\link[lme4]{cbpp}} for a description of the data.
