#' Bayesian regularized linear but big models via Stan
#' 
#' This is the same model as with \code{\link{stan_lm}} but it utilizes
#' the output from \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} in the \pkg{biglm} package
#' in order to proceed when the data is too large to fit in memory.
#' 
#' @export
#' @param biglm The list output by \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} in the \pkg{biglm}
#'   package. The original call to \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} must not have an
#'   intercept and must utilize \emph{centered} but not \emph{standardized}
#'   predictors. See the Details section or the Example.
#' @param xbar A numeric vector of means in the implicit design matrix for
#'   the observations included in the model or --- in the case of 
#'   \code{stan_biglm.fit} only --- a list of such vectors with one list element
#'   for each group
#' @param ybar A numeric scalar indicating the same mean of the outcome for
#'   the observations included in the model or --- in the case of 
#'   \code{stan_biglm.fit} only --- a numeric vector of such means with one
#'   element for each group
#' @param s_y A numeric scalar indicating the unbiased sample standard deviation
#'   of the outcome for the observations included in the model or --- in the case 
#'   of \code{stan_biglm.fit} only --- a numeric vector of such standard deviations
#'   with one element for each group
#' @param has_intercept A logical scalar indicating whether to add an intercept
#'   to the model when estimating it
#' @template args-dots
#' @param prior Must be a call to \code{\link{R2}} with its 
#'   \code{location} argument specified or \code{NULL}, which would
#'   indicate a standard uniform prior for the \eqn{R^2}.
#' @param prior_intercept Either \code{NULL} (the default) or a call to
#'   \code{\link{normal}}. If a \code{\link{normal}} prior is specified
#'   without a \code{scale}, then the standard deviation is taken to be
#'   the marginal standard deviation of the outcome divided by the square
#'   root of the sample size, which is legitimate because the marginal
#'   standard deviation of the outcome is a primitive parameter being
#'   estimated.
#' @template args-prior_PD
#' @template args-algorithm
#' @template args-adapt_delta
#' 
#' @details The \code{stan_biglm} function is intended to be used in the same
#'   circumstances as the \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} function in the \pkg{biglm}
#'   package but with an informative prior on the \eqn{R^2} of the regression.
#'   Like \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}}, the memory required to estimate the model
#'   depends largely on the number of predictors rather than the number of 
#'   observations. However, the original call to \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} must
#'   be a little unconventional. The original \code{\link[stats]{formula}} must
#'   not include an intercept and all the columns of the implicit design matrix
#'   must be expressed as deviations from the sample mean. If the design matrix
#'   is on the hard disk, the column sums must be accumulated, divided by the
#'   sample size to produce the column means, and then the column means must be
#'   swept from the design matrix on disk. If any observations have any missing
#'   values on any of the predictors or the outcome, such observations do not
#'   contribute to the column means, which must be passed as the \code{xbar}
#'   argument. If the outcome is also expressed as the deviation from its 
#'   sample mean, then the coefficients produced by \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}}
#'   are the same as if the raw data were used and an intercept were included.
#'   The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the outcome must also
#'   be passed.
#'   
#'   The \code{stan_biglm} function calls \code{stan_biglm.fit}, although the
#'   latter can be called directly. The first seven arguments to the
#'   \code{stan_biglm.fit} may be lists of the same length where the list length
#'   is equal to the number of mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups that
#'   the data have been stratified by. The \code{\link{stan_lmList}} function
#'   provides a more conventional interface for a stratified linear regression
#'   model and calls \code{stan_biglm.fit} internally.
#'   
#' @return The output of both \code{stan_biglm} and \code{stan_biglm.fit} is an object of
#'   \code{\link[rstan]{stanfit-class}} rather than \code{\link{stanreg-objects}}, 
#'   which is more limited and less convenient but necessitated by the fact that 
#'   \code{stan_biglm} does not bring the full design matrix into memory. Without the 
#'   full design matrix,some of the elements of a \code{\link{stanreg-objects}} object 
#'   cannot be calculated, such as residuals. Thus, the functions in the \pkg{rstanarm}
#'   package that input \code{\link{stanreg-objects}}, such as
#'   \code{\link{posterior_predict}} cannot be used.
