#' Bayesian regularized linear but big models via Stan
#' 
#' This is the same model as with \code{\link{stan_lm}} but it utilizes the
#' output from \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} in the \pkg{biglm} package in order to
#' proceed when the data is too large to fit in memory.
#' 
#' @export
#' @param biglm The list output by \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} in the \pkg{biglm}
#'   package. The original call to \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} must not have an 
#'   intercept and must utilize \emph{centered} but not \emph{standardized} 
#'   predictors. See the \strong{Details} and \strong{Examples} sections.
#' @param xbar A numeric vector of column means in the implicit design matrix 
#'   excluding the intercept for the observations included in the model.
#' @param ybar A numeric scalar indicating the mean of the outcome for the
#'   observations included in the model.
#' @param s_y A numeric scalar indicating the unbiased sample standard deviation
#'   of the outcome for the observations included in the model.
#' @template args-dots
#' @param prior Must be a call to \code{\link{R2}} with its \code{location}
#'   argument specified or \code{NULL}, which would indicate a standard uniform
#'   prior for the \eqn{R^2}.
#' @param prior_intercept Either \code{NULL} (the default) or a call to 
#'   \code{\link{normal}}. If a \code{\link{normal}} prior is specified without
#'   a \code{scale}, then the standard deviation is taken to be the marginal
#'   standard deviation of the outcome divided by the square root of the sample
#'   size, which is legitimate because the marginal standard deviation of the
#'   outcome is a primitive parameter being estimated.

#' @template args-algorithm
#' @template args-adapt_delta
#' 
#' @details The \code{stan_biglm} function is intended to be used in the same 
#'   circumstances as the \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}} function in the \pkg{biglm}
#'   package but with an informative prior on the \eqn{R^2} of the regression. 
#'   Like \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}}, the memory required to estimate the model 
#'   depends largely on the number of predictors rather than the number of 
#'   observations. However, \code{stan_biglm} and \code{stan_biglm.fit} have 
#'   additional required arguments that are not necessary in 
#'   \code{\link[biglm]{biglm}}, namely \code{xbar}, \code{ybar}, and \code{s_y}.
#'   If any observations have any missing values on any of the predictors or the 
#'   outcome, such observations do not contribute to these statistics.
#'   
#' @return The output of both \code{stan_biglm} and \code{stan_biglm.fit} is an
#'   object of \code{\link[rstan]{stanfit-class}} rather than
#'   \code{\link{stanreg-objects}}, which is more limited and less convenient
#'   but necessitated by the fact that \code{stan_biglm} does not bring the full
#'   design matrix into memory. Without the full design matrix,some of the
#'   elements of a \code{\link{stanreg-objects}} object cannot be calculated,
#'   such as residuals. Thus, the functions in the \pkg{rstanarm} package that
#'   input \code{\link{stanreg-objects}}, such as 
#'   \code{\link{posterior_predict}} cannot be used.
