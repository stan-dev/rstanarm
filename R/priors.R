#' Prior distributions and options
#' 
#' The functions described on this page are used to specify the prior-related
#' arguments of the various modeling functions in the \pkg{rstanarm} package (to
#' view the priors used for an existing model see \code{\link{prior_summary}}). 
#' The default priors used in the various \pkg{rstanarm} modeling functions are
#' intended to be \emph{weakly informative} in that they provide moderate
#' regularlization and help stabilize computation. For many applications the
#' defaults will perform well, but prudent use of more informative priors is
#' encouraged. Uniform prior distributions are possible (e.g. by setting
#' \code{\link{stan_glm}}'s \code{prior} argument to \code{NULL}) but, unless
#' the data is very strong, they are not recommended and are \emph{not}
#' non-informative, giving the same probability mass to implausible values as
#' plausible ones.
#' 
#' @export 
#' @name priors
#' @param location Prior location. For \code{normal} and \code{student_t} 
#'   (provided that \code{df > 1}) this is the prior mean. For \code{cauchy} 
#'   (which is equivalent to \code{student_t} with \code{df=1}), the mean does 
#'   not exist and \code{location} is the prior median. The default value is 
#'   \eqn{0}, except for \code{R2} which has no default value for
#'   \code{location}. For \code{R2}, \code{location} pertains to the prior
#'   location of the \eqn{R^2} under a Beta distribution, but the interpretation
#'   of the \code{location} parameter depends on the specified value of the
#'   \code{what} argument (see the "R2 family" section in Details).
#' @param scale Prior scale. The default depends on the family (see Details).
#' @param df,df1,df2 Prior degrees of freedom. The default is \eqn{1} for 
#'   \code{student_t}, in which case it is equivalent to \code{cauchy}. For the
#'   hierarchical shrinkage priors (\code{hs} and \code{hs_plus}) the degrees of
#'   freedom parameter(s) default to \eqn{3}.
#' @param what A character string among \code{'mode'} (the default),
#'   \code{'mean'}, \code{'median'}, or \code{'log'} indicating how the
#'   \code{location} parameter is interpreted in the \code{LKJ} case. If
#'   \code{'log'}, then \code{location} is interpreted as the expected
#'   logarithm of the \eqn{R^2} under a Beta distribution. Otherwise,
#'   \code{location} is interpreted as the \code{what} of the \eqn{R^2}
#'   under a Beta distribution. If the number of predictors is less than
#'   or equal to two, the mode of this Beta distribution does not exist
#'   and an error will prompt the user to specify another choice for
#'   \code{what}.
#'   
#' @details The details depend on the family of the prior being used:
#' \subsection{Student t family}{
#'   Family members:
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item \code{normal(location, scale)}
#'   \item \code{student_t(df, location, scale)}
#'   \item \code{cauchy(location, scale)}
#'   }
#'   
#'   For the prior distribution for the intercept, \code{location}, 
#'   \code{scale}, and \code{df} should be scalars. For the prior for the other
#'   coefficients they can either be vectors of length equal to the number of
#'   coefficients (not including the intercept), or they can be scalars, in 
#'   which case they will be recycled to the appropriate length. As the 
#'   degrees of freedom approaches infinity, the Student t distribution 
#'   approaches the normal distribution and if the degrees of freedom are one,
#'   then the Student t distribution is the Cauchy distribution.
#'   
#'   If \code{scale} is not specified it will default to 10 for the intercept
#'   and 2.5 for the other coefficients, unless the probit link function is
#'   used, in which case these defaults are scaled by a factor of 
#'   \code{dnorm(0)/dlogis(0)}, which is roughly 1.6.
#'   
#'   If the \code{scaled} argument to \code{prior_options} is \code{TRUE} (the
#'   default), then the scales will be further adjusted as described above in
#'   the documentation of the \code{scaled} argument in the \strong{Arguments} 
#'   section.
#' }
#' \subsection{Hierarchical shrinkage family}{
#'   Family members:
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item \code{hs(df)}
#'   \item \code{hs_plus(df1, df2)}
#'   }
#'   
#'   The hierarchical shrinkage priors are normal with a mean of zero and a 
#'   standard deviation that is also a random variable. The traditional 
#'   hierarchical shrinkage prior utilizes a standard deviation that is 
#'   distributed half Cauchy with a median of zero and a scale parameter that is
#'   also half Cauchy. This is called the "horseshoe prior". The hierarchical 
#'   shrinkage (\code{hs}) prior in the \pkg{rstanarm} package instead utilizes 
#'   a half Student t distribution for the standard deviation (with 3 degrees of
#'   freedom by default), scaled by a half Cauchy parameter, as described by
#'   Piironen and Vehtari (2015). It is possible to change the \code{df}
#'   argument, the prior degrees of freedom, to obtain less or more shrinkage.
#'   
#'   The hierarhical shrinkpage plus (\code{hs_plus}) prior is a normal with a 
#'   mean of zero and a standard deviation that is distributed as the product of
#'   two independent half Student t parameters (both with 3 degrees of freedom
#'   (\code{df1}, \code{df2}) by default) that are each scaled by the same
#'   square root of a half Cauchy parameter.
#'   
#'   These hierarchical shrinkage priors have very tall modes and very fat 
#'   tails. Consequently, they tend to produce posterior distributions that are
#'   very concentrated near zero, unless the predictor has a strong influence on
#'   the outcome, in which case the prior has little influence. Hierarchical
#'   shrinkage priors often require you to increase the 
#'   \code{\link{adapt_delta}} tuning parameter in order to diminish the number
#'   of divergent transitions. For more details on tuning parameters and
#'   divergent transitions see the Troubleshooting section of the 
#'   \emph{How to Use the rstanarm Package} vignette.
#' }
#' \subsection{Dirichlet family}{
#'   Family members:
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item \code{dirichlet(concentration)}
#'   }
#'   
#'   The Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the beta
#'   distribution. It is perhaps the easiest prior distribution to specify
#'   because the concentration parameters can be interpreted as prior counts
#'   (although they need not be integers) of a multinomial random variable.
#'   
#'   The Dirichlet distribution is used in \code{\link{stan_polr}} for an 
#'   implicit prior on the cutpoints in an ordinal regression model. More
#'   specifically, the Dirichlet prior pertains to the prior probability of
#'   observing each category of the ordinal outcome when the predictors are at
#'   their sample means. Given these prior probabilities, it is straightforward
#'   to add them to form cumulative probabilities and then use an inverse CDF
#'   transformation of the cumulative probabilities to define the cutpoints.
#'   
#'   If a scalar is passed to the \code{concentration} argument of the 
#'   \code{dirichlet} function, then it is replicated to the appropriate length 
#'   and the Dirichlet distribution is symmetric. If \code{concentration} is a
#'   vector and all elements are \eqn{1}, then the Dirichlet distribution is
#'   jointly uniform. If all concentration parameters are equal but greater than
#'   \eqn{1} then the prior mode is that the categories are equiprobable, and
#'   the larger the value of the identical concentration parameters, the more
#'   sharply peaked the distribution is at the mode. The elements in 
#'   \code{concentration} can also be given different values to represent that 
#'   not all outcome categories are a priori equiprobable.
#' }
#' \subsection{Covariance matrices}{
#'   Family members:
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item \code{decov(regularization, concentration, shape, scale)}
#'   }
#'   (Also see vignette for \code{stan_glmer})
#'   
#'   Covariance matrices are decomposed into correlation matrices and 
#'   variances. The variances are in turn decomposed into the product of a
#'   simplex vector and the trace of the matrix. Finally, the trace is the
#'   product of the order of the matrix and the square of a scale parameter.
#'   This prior on a covariance matrix is represented by the \code{decov} 
#'   function.
#'   
#'   The prior for a correlation matrix is called LKJ whose density is 
#'   proportional to the determinant of the correlation matrix raised to the 
#'   power of a positive regularization parameter minus one. If
#'   \code{regularization = 1} (the default), then this prior is jointly 
#'   uniform over all correlation matrices of that size. If 
#'   \code{regularization > 1}, then the identity matrix is the mode and in the
#'   unlikely case that \code{regularization < 1}, the identity matrix is the
#'   trough.
#'   
#'   The trace of a covariance matrix is equal to the sum of the variances. We
#'   set the trace equal to the product of the order of the covariance matrix
#'   and the \emph{square} of a positive scale parameter. The particular
#'   variances are set equal to the product of a simplex vector --- which is
#'   non-negative and sums to \eqn{1} --- and the scalar trace. In other words,
#'   each element of the simplex vector represents the proportion of the trace
#'   attributable to the corresponding variable.
#'   
#'   A symmetric Dirichlet prior is used for the simplex vector, which has a 
#'   single (positive) \code{concentration} parameter, which defaults to
#'   \eqn{1} and implies that the prior is jointly uniform over the space of
#'   simplex vectors of that size. If \code{concentration > 1}, then the prior
#'   mode corresponds to all variables having the same (proportion of total)
#'   variance, which can be used to ensure the the posterior variances are not
#'   zero. As the \code{concentration} parameter approaches infinity, this
#'   mode becomes more pronounced. In the unlikely case that 
#'   \code{concentration < 1}, the variances are more polarized.
#'   
#'   If all the variables were multiplied by a number, the trace of their 
#'   covariance matrix would increase by that number squared. Thus, it is 
#'   reasonable to use a scale-invariant prior distribution for the positive
#'   scale parameter, and in this case we utilize a Gamma distribution, whose
#'   \code{shape} and \code{scale} are both \eqn{1} by default, implying a
#'   unit-exponential distribution. Set the \code{shape} hyperparameter to some
#'   value greater than \eqn{1} to ensure that the posterior trace is not zero.
#'   
#'   If \code{regularization}, \code{concentration}, \code{shape} and / or 
#'   \code{scale} are positive scalars, then they are recycled to the 
#'   appropriate length. Otherwise, each can be a positive vector of the 
#'   appropriate length, but the appropriate length depends on the number of 
#'   covariance matrices in the model and their sizes. A one-by-one covariance 
#'   matrix is just a variance and thus does not have \code{regularization} or 
#'   \code{concentration} parameters, but does have \code{shape} and 
#'   \code{scale} parameters for the prior standard deviation of that 
#'   variable.
#' }
#' \subsection{R2 family}{
#'   Family members:
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item \code{R2(location, what)}
#'   }
#'   
#'   The \code{\link{stan_lm}}, \code{\link{stan_aov}}, and 
#'   \code{\link{stan_polr}} functions allow the user to utilize a function 
#'   called \code{R2} to convey prior information about all the parameters. 
#'   This prior hinges on prior beliefs about the location of \eqn{R^2}, the 
#'   proportion of variance in the outcome attributable to the predictors, 
#'   which has a \code{\link[stats]{Beta}} prior with first shape 
#'   hyperparameter equal to half the number of predictors and second shape 
#'   hyperparameter free. By specifying \code{what} to be the prior mode (the
#'   default), mean, median, or expected log of \eqn{R^2}, the second shape
#'   parameter for this Beta distribution is determined internally. If
#'   \code{what = 'log'}, location should be a negative scalar; otherwise it
#'   should be a scalar on the \eqn{(0,1)} interval.
#'   
#'   For example, if \eqn{R^2 = 0.5}, then the mode, mean, and median of
#'   the \code{\link[stats]{Beta}} distribution are all the same and thus the
#'   second shape parameter is also equal to half the number of predictors.
#'   The second shape parameter of the \code{\link[stats]{Beta}} distribution
#'   is actually the same as the shape parameter in the LKJ prior for a
#'   correlation matrix described in the previous subsection. Thus, the smaller 
#'   is \eqn{R^2}, the larger is the shape parameter, the smaller are the
#'   prior correlations among the outcome and predictor variables, and the more
#'   concentrated near zero is the prior density for the regression 
#'   coefficients. Hence, the prior on the coefficients is regularizing and 
#'   should yield a posterior distribution with good out-of-sample predictions 
#'   \emph{if} the prior location of \eqn{R^2} is specified in a reasonable 
#'   fashion.
#' }
#' @return A named list to be used internally by the \pkg{rstanarm} model
#'   fitting functions.

#'   and demonstrate the use of some of the supported prior distributions.
