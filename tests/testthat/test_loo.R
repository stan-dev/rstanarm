# These tests just check that the loo.stanreg method (which calls loo.function 
# method) results are identical to the loo.matrix results. Since for these tests
# the log-likelihood matrix is computed using the log-likelihood function, the 
# only thing these tests really do is make sure that loo.stanreg and all the 
# log-likelihood functions don't return any errors and whatnot (it does not
# check that the results returned by loo are actually correct).
