\arguments{
\item{formula, data, subset}{Same as \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, 
but \emph{we strongly advise against omitting the \code{data}
argument}. Unless \code{data} is specified (and is a data frame) many
post-estimation functions (including \code{update}, \code{loo},
\code{kfold}) are not guaranteed to work properly.}

\item{projections}{For \code{stan_aov}, a logical scalar (defaulting to
\code{FALSE}) indicating whether \code{\link[stats]{proj}} should be called
on the fit.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the function in the \pkg{rstan} 
package (\code{\link[rstan:stanmodel-method-sampling]{sampling}}, 
\code{\link[rstan:stanmodel-method-vb]{vb}}, or 
\code{\link[rstan:stanmodel-method-optimizing]{optimizing}}), 
corresponding to the estimation method named by \code{algorithm}. For example, 
if \code{algorithm} is \code{"sampling"} it is possible to specify \code{iter}, 
\code{chains}, \code{cores}, and other MCMC controls.  

Another useful argument that can be passed to \pkg{rstan} via \code{...} is
\code{refresh}, which specifies how often to print updates when sampling
(i.e., show the progress every \code{refresh} iterations). \code{refresh=0}
turns off the iteration updates.}

\item{prior}{Must be a call to \code{\link{R2}} with its 
\code{location} argument specified or \code{NULL}, which would
indicate a standard uniform prior for the \eqn{R^2}.}

\item{prior_PD}{A logical scalar (defaulting to \code{FALSE}) indicating
whether to draw from the prior predictive distribution instead of
conditioning on the outcome.}

\item{algorithm}{A string (possibly abbreviated) indicating the 
estimation approach to use. Can be \code{"sampling"} for MCMC (the
default), \code{"optimizing"} for optimization, \code{"meanfield"} for
variational inference with independent normal distributions, or
\code{"fullrank"} for variational inference with a multivariate normal
distribution. See \code{\link{rstanarm-package}} for more details on the
estimation algorithms. NOTE: not all fitting functions support all four
algorithms.}

\item{adapt_delta}{Only relevant if \code{algorithm="sampling"}. See 
the \link{adapt_delta} help page for details.}

\item{na.action, singular.ok, contrasts}{Same as \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, but 
rarely specified.}

\item{model, offset, weights}{Same as \code{\link[stats]{lm}}, but
rarely specified.}

\item{x, y}{In \code{stan_lm, stan_aov}, logical scalars indicating whether to
return the design matrix and response vector. In \code{stan_lm.fit or stan_lm.wfit},
a design matrix and response vector.}

\item{prior_intercept}{Either \code{NULL} (the default) or a call to
\code{\link{normal}}. If a \code{\link{normal}} prior is specified
without a \code{scale}, then the standard deviation is taken to be
the marginal standard deviation of the outcome divided by the square
root of the sample size, which is legitimate because the marginal
standard deviation of the outcome is a primitive parameter being
estimated.

\strong{Note:} If using a dense representation of the design matrix
---i.e., if the \code{sparse} argument is left at its default value of
\code{FALSE}--- then the prior distribution for the intercept is set so it
applies to the value \emph{when all predictors are centered}. If you prefer
to specify a prior on the intercept without the predictors being
auto-centered, then you have to omit the intercept from the
\code{\link[stats]{formula}} and include a column of ones as a predictor,
in which case some element of \code{prior} specifies the prior on it,
rather than \code{prior_intercept}. Regardless of how
\code{prior_intercept} is specified, the reported \emph{estimates} of the
intercept always correspond to a parameterization without centered
predictors (i.e., same as in \code{glm}).}

\item{w}{Same as in \code{lm.wfit} but rarely specified.}
}
\value{
A \link[=stanreg-objects]{stanreg} object is returned 
for \code{stan_lm, stan_aov}.

A \link[=stanfit-class]{stanfit} object (or a slightly modified 
  stanfit object) is returned if \code{stan_lm.fit or stan_lm.wfit} is called directly.

\description{
\if{html}{\figure{stanlogo.png}{options: width="25" alt="https://mc-stan.org/about/logo/"}}
Bayesian inference for linear modeling with regularizing priors on the model
parameters that are driven by prior beliefs about \eqn{R^2}, the proportion
of variance in the outcome attributable to the predictors. See
\code{\link{priors}} for an explanation of this critical point.
\code{\link{stan_glm}} with \code{family="gaussian"} also estimates a linear
model with normally-distributed errors and allows for various other priors on
the coefficients.
}
\details{
The \code{stan_lm} function is similar in syntax to the 
  \code{\link[stats]{lm}} function but rather than choosing the parameters to
  minimize the sum of squared residuals, samples from the posterior 
  distribution are drawn using MCMC (if \code{algorithm} is
  \code{"sampling"}). The \code{stan_lm} function has a formula-based
  interface and would usually be called by users but the \code{stan_lm.fit}
  and \code{stan_lm.wfit} functions might be called by other functions that
  parse the data themselves and are analogous to \code{lm.fit}
  and \code{lm.wfit} respectively.
     
  In addition to estimating \code{sigma} --- the standard deviation of the
  normally-distributed errors --- this model estimates a positive parameter
  called \code{log-fit_ratio}. If it is positive, the marginal posterior 
  variance of the outcome will exceed the sample variance of the outcome
  by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of \code{fit_ratio}.
  Conversely if \code{log-fit_ratio} is negative, then the model underfits.
  Given the regularizing nature of the priors, a slight underfit is good.
  
  Finally, the posterior predictive distribution is generated with the
  predictors fixed at their sample means. This quantity is useful for
  checking convergence because it is reasonably normally distributed
  and a function of all the parameters in the model.
  
  The \code{stan_aov} function is similar to \code{\link[stats]{aov}}, but
  does a Bayesian analysis of variance that is basically equivalent to
  \code{stan_lm} with dummy variables. \code{stan_aov} has a somewhat
  customized \code{\link{print}} method that prints an ANOVA-like table in
  addition to the output printed for \code{stan_lm} models.
