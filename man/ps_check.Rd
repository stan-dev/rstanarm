ps_check(
  object,
  check = "survival",
  limits = c("ci", "none"),

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object returned by the 
\code{\link{stan_surv}} or \code{\link{stan_jm}} modelling function. 
See \code{\link{stanreg-objects}}.}

\item{check}{The type of plot to show. Currently only "survival" is
allowed, which compares the estimated standardised survival curve
based on the fitted model to the estimated Kaplan-Meier survival 
curve based on the observed data.}

\item{limits}{A quoted character string specifying the type of limits to
include in the plot. Can be one of: \code{"ci"} for the Bayesian
posterior uncertainty interval (often known as a credible interval);
or \code{"none"} for no interval limits.}

\item{draws}{Passed to the \code{draws} argument of 
\code{\link{posterior_survfit}}. It must be an integer indicating the 
number of MCMC draws to use to when evaluating the posterior estimate
of the standardised survival curve. The default is 400 for 
\code{stan_surv} models or 200 for \code{stan_jm} models (or
equal to the posterior sample size if it is smaller than that).}

\item{npoints}{The number of time points at which to predict the survival 
function. The plot of the survival curve is generated by interpolating
along these points using \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_line}}.}

\item{seed}{An optional \code{\link[=set.seed]{seed}} to use.}

\item{xlab, ylab}{An optional axis label passed to 
\code{\link[ggplot2]{labs}}.}

\item{ci_geom_args}{Optional arguments passed to 
\code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_ribbon}} and used to control features
of the plotted interval limits. They should be supplied as a named list.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments passed to 
\code{\link[ggplot2:geom_path]{geom_line}} and used to control features
of the plotted trajectory.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object that can be further customized using the
  \pkg{ggplot2} package.
}
\description{
This function plots the estimated standardised survival curve for the
estimation sample based on draws from the posterior distribution of the 
fitted model, and then overlays a Kaplan-Meier survival curve based 
on the observed data.

  subject-specific survival function based on draws of the model parameters
