#' @param QR A logical scalar defaulting to \code{FALSE}, but if \code{TRUE} 
#'   applies a scaled \code{\link{qr}} decomposition to the design matrix, 
#'   \eqn{X = Q^\ast R^\ast}{X = Q* R*}, where \eqn{Q^\ast = Q \sqrt{n-1}}{Q* = 
#'   Q (n-1)^0.5} and \eqn{R^\ast = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}} R}{R* = (n-1)^(-0.5) 
#'   R}. The coefficients relative to \eqn{Q^\ast}{Q*} are obtained and then 
#'   premultiplied by the inverse of \eqn{R^{\ast}}{R*} to obtain coefficients 
#'   relative to the original predictors, \eqn{X}. These transformations do not 
#'   change the likelihood of the data but are recommended for computational 
#'   reasons when there are multiple predictors. Importantly, while the columns
#'   of \eqn{X} are almost always correlated, the columns of \eqn{Q^\ast}{Q*}
#'   are uncorrelated by design, which often makes sampling from the posterior
#'   easier. However, because when \code{QR} is \code{TRUE} the \code{prior}
#'   argument applies to the coefficients relative to \eqn{Q^\ast}{Q*} (and
#'   those are not very interpretable), setting \code{QR=TRUE} is only
#'   recommended if you do not have an informative prior for the regression
#'   coefficients.
