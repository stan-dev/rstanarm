#' @param QR A logical scalar (defaulting to \code{FALSE}) but if \code{TRUE} 
#'   applies a scaled \code{\link{qr}} decomposition to the design matrix, 
#'   \eqn{X = Q^\ast R^\ast}{X = Q* R*}, where \eqn{Q^\ast = Q \sqrt{n-1}}{Q* =
#'   Q (n-1)^0.5} and \eqn{R^\ast = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n-1}} R}{R* = (n-1)^(-0.5)
#'   R}. The coefficients relative to \eqn{Q^\ast}{Q*} are obtained and then
#'   premultiplied by the inverse of \eqn{R^{\ast}}{R*} to obtain coefficients
#'   relative to the original predictors, \eqn{X}. These transformations do not
#'   change the likelihood of the data but are recommended for computational
#'   reasons when there are multiple predictors. However, because when \code{QR}
#'   is \code{TRUE} the \code{prior} argument applies to the coefficients
#'   relative to \eqn{Q^\ast}{Q*} (and those are not very interpretable) it is
#'   hard to specify an informative prior. Setting \code{QR=TRUE} is therefore
#'   only recommended if you do not have an informative prior for the regression
#'   coefficients.
