## Abstract

This case study shows how basic A/B testing using Stan and Bayesian methods can
be used to facilitate business decisions. In practice, we find this approach
useful given its ability to quantify domain-specific business knowledge and
hypotheses through the use of prior distributions. Instead of using p-values and
confidence intervals, we are able to perform inference with _probability_
intervals estimated from posterior predictions. In addition to the results being
highly interpretable, this approach allows us to quantify business risk.

## Introduction

A/B testing is an experiment. It is essentially a randomized controlled trial
in an industry setting. The test or experiment is conducted on a
subset of users in order to determine if a change in service (e.g. user
experience) will have a positive impact on the business, before rolling out that
change to all the users. (Here we consider _static_ A/B testing where inference
is performed after the experiment. For A/B testing where the users are
_dynamically_ allocated to the outperforming group during the experiment
consider _multi-arm bandits_.)

Here are a few stylized scenarios where A/B testing could provide useful insight:

* If you change the order in which information is displayed on a service will
users spend more time on the service?
* If you personalize the cover art for streaming content are users more likely
to stream that content?
* Are users more responsive to a revised recommendation system?
* Is there a noticeable difference between the three point accuracy of two
basketball players?
* In a drug trial, is there evidence that the treatment is better than the
placebo?

Typically, A/B testing involves one group of people being served the existing
content (control group, group A) while another group is served different content
(treatment group, group B) and, through a measurable indicator, the business
wants to determine if there is a difference in reaction between the two groups.
If we compare the two groups and find that the difference in the indicator is
large (relative to our uncertainty) then we can argue that the different content
drove that change. Conversely, if the change was minimal then we may be hesitant
to conclude that the different content resulted in any change in behavior at
all. In that situation perhaps the content needs to be redesigned and retested.

Most A/B testing approaches used in practice typically rely on frequentist
hypothesis testing methods. Not only are the results of these methods difficult
to interpret, but they can also be misleading. Terms such as "p-values" and
"confidence intervals" are often misinterpreted as probabilities directly
related to the quantity of interest (e.g. the difference in means between two
groups). P-values are also often used as cutoffs for business
decisions. In other words, reaching a statistically significant result is often
sufficient to convince a business to move forward with a particular decision.

We argue that these decisions should not be reductively derived from arbitrary
cutoffs (e.g. a p-value of less than 0.05). Instead they should be determined by
domain-specific experts who understand the industry, with statisticians
providing interpretable results that can help these experts make more informed
decisions. This case study provides a way for domain-specific experts to apply
their knowledge to the statistical inference process of A/B testing through
prior distributions. Additionally, the experts can quantify the risk they are
willing to take and probabilistically incorporate this into the inference.

Some key benefits to the Bayesian approach outlined in this case study include,

* Allowing domain-specific experts to apply their knowledge and appetite for
risk to statistical inference.
* Modeling the data rather than defining/computing a test statistic from the
data. (This allows us to perform inference on the (predicted) data instead of
the parameters.)
* The ability to describe differences in groups probabilistically rather than
using traditional hypothesis testing methods.
* Quantifying null hypotheses in priors.

We use simple examples to show how to apply Bayesian inference to A/B testing
using continuous and count data. The examples used here are analogous to the
t-test and the Fisher's exact test, but the methodology discussed can be applied
to data that follow other distributions. The first section considers continuous
data (assumed to be generated from the normal distribution) and the second
section considers count data (assumed to be generated from the binomial
distribution). (If you need a referesher on how convoluted hypothesis testing
is, Appendix A goes over the interpretation of p-values using a two-sample
t-test as an example.)

At a high-level, we stress that frequentist methods focus on the distribution of
the test statistic as opposed to the quantity of interest (i.e. predictions or
parameters). In such methods inference is done by understanding how the observed
test statistic compares to the distribution of the test statistic under the null
hypothesis. Alternatively, the Bayesian approach proposed here allows the
statistician to perform inference directly on the quantity of interest (in this
case predicted data), which is more transparent and informative in the context
of A/B testing.

## Continuous Data

_This example is analogous to the two sample t-test (specifically Welch's
t-test) where the statistician is interested in testing if there is a noticeable
difference between the means of two different samples._

Suppose an online streaming company is interested in testing whether ads affect
the consumption of their service. The hypothesis is that reducing ads will
increase hourly streaming consumption. Since this decision can be costly if a
significant amount of revenue is derived from ads, it would be useful to conduct
a test to evaluate the impact of ad reduction. One way to test this is to draw
two random samples from the user base, serve them with different levels of ad
content, and see if there is a substantial difference in streaming consumption
(say hours per day). Suppose we treat the two groups in the following way,

* Group A (control): streaming service contains ads.
* Group B (treatment): streaming service contains no ads.

The data collected might look something like the following below. Each
observation is a user's average daily streaming consumption in hours. Suppose we
also have an additional (binary) variable `hc` which defines whether a user is
predisposed to being a _high consumer_ of streaming content (a value of 1
represents a high consumer and a value of -1 represents a low consumer).

```{r}
set.seed(123)
group <- c(rep(1,10), rep(2,12))
group <- factor(c(rep("A",10), rep("B",12)))
N <- length(group)
hc <- sample(c(-1,1), N, replace = TRUE)
effect <- c(3,5)

lp <- effect[group] + 0.7*hc
y <- rnorm(N, lp, 0.5)

experiment <- data.frame(y = y,
                         group = factor(group),
                         hc = hc)
experiment
```

In order to determine if there is a difference between the groups we need to
define a model that predicts the outcome for each group. The data has been
generated from the normal distribution so it is appropriate to specify a normal
likelihood. (Often we do not know how the data is generated and have to make an
assumption about which distribution should be used to model the likelihood.) Since we
are _modeling_ the outcome we can include other variables, such as the high
consumer indicator `hc`. Traditional hypothesis testing methods are focused on
comparing the outcome of two groups. Here we model the outcome before comparing
the groups. This allows us to include additional information in the model which
will enable us to perform more granular inferences.

Next we need to specify prior distributions on each of these parameters. This is
where the domain-specific expert can provide valuable input. For example, they
may believe that (due to poor sampling) the sampled average of daily streaming
hours is too low for each group. In such a situation a prior can be applied to
coerce the estimated average closer to the value they feel is more appropriate
and representative of the population.

Putting these pieces together gives us the model below. $y$ is the outcome
(average streaming hours) and $sigma$ is the residual standard deviation (i.e.
the standard deviation of $y$ conditional on the parameters and the data). $\mu$
is the parameter associated with the variable $group$ which defines group
membership, and $\beta$ is the parameter associated with the the high consumer
indicator. One limitation of this approach is that $\sigma$ does not vary among
groups. However, in this case it is sufficient to assume that the outcome of
both groups has the same standard deviation. (In order to allow the standard
deviation to vary among groups the model would have to be fit in
[**rstan**](https://mc-stan.org/rstan/), which would require defining the model
in a Stan file.)

$$
\begin{align*}
y_i \sim &\mathcal{N}(\mu_A \cdot groupA_i + \mu_B \cdot groupB_i + \beta \cdot high\_consumer_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_A \sim& \mathcal{N}(3,1) \\
\mu_B \sim& \mathcal{N}(3,1) \\
\beta \sim& \mathcal{N}(0,1) \\
& \mbox{(default prior specified on } \sigma \mbox{)}
\end{align*}
$$

With regard to priors, we have applied $\mathcal{N}(3,1)$ distributions on both
group effects. The reasoning behind this is twofold:

1. Based on prior knowledge (past data and/or domain specific experts) we
believe that users spend around three hours per day on the service (regardless
of what our random sample says).
2. We allow the hyperparameters for both group groups to be identical to
quantify our belief that group B (which received the treatment) is not
substantially different from group A. This can be interpreted as incorporating
the belief underlying our null hypothesis into the prior. More importantly, this
approach allows us to be more conservative when we do our inference. If we end
up concluding that the two groups are different, we can say that the difference
in behavior was so strong that it overcame our prior belief that the two groups
are identical.

<!-- Wouldn't it be better to base the prior on past data or a reasonable guess based on expertise rather than on the data to be used for the analysis? -->

Now that we have established our model, we need to fit the model to the data so
that we can estimate the parameters. We can do this using the
[**rstanarm**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/) package which can fit a Bayesian
linear regression model (using the `stan_glm()` function) without an intercept,
and with group membership and additional variables as parameters. We fit the
model below.

```{r results='hide'}
fit <- stan_glm(y ~ 0 + group + hc,
                data = experiment,
                family = gaussian(link="identity"),
                prior = normal(c(3,3,0), 1),
                seed = 123)
```

Recall that Stan uses a sampling algorithm to estimate the joint posterior
distribution of the parameters which means that we have samples instead of point
estimates for the parameter values. The medians for each parameter are provided
below.

```{r}
c(coef(fit), sigma = sigma(fit))
```

With these estimates it looks like Group A had an average consumption of about 3
hours while Group B had an average consumption of about 5 hours. This gives us a
difference in consumption of approximately 2 hours. Unfortunately, this
assessment does not say anything about how uncertain this difference is. We
would like to be able to say something like "we are $p\%$ sure that the two
groups are different enough".

<!-- I don't think the point is whether they are different (of course they are!), but rather are they _enough_ different to merit switching, right? -->

We can quantify the uncertainty of how different the two estimates are by
computing sample quantiles on the posterior predictive distribution. This is
often referred to as a credible interval, although the preferred term is
_predictive interval_ when describing predictions (and _posterior interval_ when
describing parameters).

<!-- I would say something like 'This is often referred to as a credible interval, although we prefer "predictive interval" when describing predictions (and "posterior interval" when describing parameters).' And then I wouldn't use credible interval anymore, although up to you.-->

<!-- It is also refered to as the highest density interval (Kruschke 2015). -->
<!-- Actually I don't think they're exactly synonyms. I think the terms credible interval and posterior interval are more general. HDI refers to a particular way to define the interval that's different than using quantiles (central intervals). -->

If we compute the $90\%$ predictive interval then we can say that $90\%$ of the
posterior predictions for that group lie between that interval. In order for us
to evaluate whether the two groups are different enough we can compute the
[overlap coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient), which
describes the overlap of the prediction intervals for each group as a
proportion. For example, suppose there is a $15\%$ overlap between the $90\%$
prediction intervals in each of the two groups. This allows us to say, given
that we are $90\%$ certain about where the predictions lie, there's a $15\%$
chance that the two groups are similar.

<!-- I think it would be helpful to compare looking at differences in predictions to looking at differences in the _parameters_. Most people will think the natural thing to do is to compare the posterior distributions of the parameters (which isn't _horrible_), but I prefer the approach you're using of comparing predictions. I just think it's necessary to compare/distinguish between them. -->

The functions below compute the proportion of overlap between the two groups.

```{r}
#' Quantify Overlapping Proportion
#' Compute how much of the smaller distribution overlaps with the larger (i.e. wider) distribution.
#' @param large Posterior predictive samples that have larger range than \code{small}.

overlap_prop <- function(large, small, p = 1) {
  p_lwr <- (1-p)/2
  p_upr <- 1 - p_lwr
  large_ci <- quantile(large, probs = c(p_lwr, p_upr))

  return(length(indxs)/length(small))
}

overlap <- function(a, b, p = 1) {
  length_a <- dist(range(a))
  length_b <- dist(range(b))
  if (length_a >= length_b) {
    out <- overlap_prop(a, b, p)
  }
  else if (length_a < length_b) {
    out <- overlap_prop(b, a, p)
  }
  return(out)
}
```

Below we compute the $0.9$ prediction interval for both groups. Note that the
prediction interval choice is arbitrary, and may vary depending on the applied
context and the appetite for uncertainty. This is also where we recommend
getting input from domain-specific experts. In this case we are willing to
accept a $10\%$ chance of being wrong about where the predictions lie. The
closer the prediction interval is to $1$ the more risk averse the business is
with regards to inference.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=8, fig.width=6}
pp_a <- posterior_predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("A"), hc = experiment$hc))
pp_b <- posterior_predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("B"), hc = experiment$hc))
pp_a_quant <- quantile(pp_a, probs = c(0.05,0.95))
pp_b_quant <- quantile(pp_b, probs = c(0.05,0.95))

overlap(pp_a, pp_b, p = 0.9)

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
# group A
hist(pp_a, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group A",
     xlab = "Avg Streaming (hrs)",
     xlim = c(0,10))
abline(v = pp_a_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_a_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
# group B
hist(pp_b, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group B",
     xlab = "Avg Streaming (hrs)",
     xlim = c(0,10))
abline(v = pp_b_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_b_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
```

<!-- hist(pp_a) is plotting a single histogram combining all 12 columns of the `pp_a` matrix. is that intentional? if you you my idea above about doing this in one mode for `y ~ group` then I think you just want to predict two new observations, one from A one from B and compare their predictive distributions. should be easier to do with bayesplot that way too!-->

After computing the $90\%$ prediction interval for both groups we find an
overlap proportion of approximately $0.25$. Thus, given that we are $90\%$ sure
about our posterior predictions for the two groups, we are about $75\%$ sure
that the two groups are in fact different. Going back to the business context,
we can conclude that we are $75\%$ sure that reducing ads increases daily
streaming consumption given our acceptable risk of being $10\%$ wrong about
daily streaming consumption. <!-- Given our modeling assumptions, etc. -->

Since we modeled the outcome using a predictor (in addition to group membership
variables) we can vary the predictor as well as group membership for an
observation for more detailed inference. Below we plot the prediction intervals
for each group and high consumer variable combination. This allows to us compare
the difference in average streaming hours among the two groups for those
individuals that were categorized as high/low consumers.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
pp_a0 <- posterior_predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("A"), hc = -1))
pp_b0 <- posterior_predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("B"), hc = -1))
pp_a1 <- posterior_predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("A"), hc = 1))
pp_b1 <- posterior_predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("B"), hc = 1))
pp_a0_quant <- quantile(pp_a0, probs = c(0.05,0.95))
pp_b0_quant <- quantile(pp_b0, probs = c(0.05,0.95))
pp_a1_quant <- quantile(pp_a1, probs = c(0.05,0.95))
pp_b1_quant <- quantile(pp_b1, probs = c(0.05,0.95))

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
# group A, x = 0
hist(pp_a0, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group A (hc=-1)",
     xlab = "Avg Streaming (hrs)",
     xlim = c(0,10))
abline(v = pp_a0_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_a0_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
# group B, x = 0
hist(pp_b0, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group B (hc=-1)",
     xlab = "Avg Streaming (hrs)",
     xlim = c(0,10))
abline(v = pp_b0_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_b0_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
# group A, x = 1
hist(pp_a1, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group A (hc=1)",
     xlab = "Avg Streaming (hrs)",
     xlim = c(0,10))
abline(v = pp_a1_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_a1_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
# group B, x = 1
hist(pp_b1, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group B (hc=1)",
     xlab = "Avg Streaming (hrs)",
     xlim = c(0,10))
abline(v = pp_b1_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_b1_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
```

In the plot below we show how the overlap proportion will vary as the prediction
interval varies. To put it differently, it shows how the probabilistic
difference between groups varies as risk varies. Notice that the more risk we
take when defining our prediction interval (i.e. the closer the prediction
interval is to 0) the lower the overlap proportion, and consequentially the more
apparent the difference between the two groups.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
# prediction interval probabilities
ci_p <- seq(0.1,1, by = 0.05)
# compute proportions
overlap_ab <- sapply(ci_p, function(s){overlap(pp_a, pp_b, s)})
# plot
plot(ci_p, overlap_ab, type = "o", pch = 20,
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     main = "Group A vs Group B",
     xlab = "Prediction Interval Probability (1-Risk)",
     ylab = "Overlap Proportion (Group Similarity)")
axis(1, seq(0,1,by=0.1), cex.axis = 0.8)
axis(2, seq(0,1,by=0.1), cex.axis = 0.8)
abline(v = 0.5, lty = 2)
```
<!-- Maybe ggplot2::qplot(x = ci_p, y = overlap_ab, geom = c("line", "point")) ?-->

## Count Data

_This example is analogous to Fisher's exact test where the statistician is
interested in testing differences in proportions (particularly in the form of a
contingency table)._

Now, suppose that the business wants to know whether a product sells better if
there is a change to the online user interface (UI) that users interact with to
buy the product. They run an experiment on two groups and obtain the following
results,

* Group C (control): 10 users out of a sample of 19 purchased the product with
the default UI.
* Group D (treatment): 14 users out of a sample of 22 purchased the product with
the alternative UI.

Here we can assume that the data is binomially distributed, in which case we can
define the model for the the two groups as follows,

$$
y_i \sim \mbox{Bin}(\mbox{logit}^{-1}(\mu_C \cdot groupC_i + \mu_D \cdot groupD_i), N_i)\\
$$

where $\mu$ is the parameter for each group, $group$ is a binary variable
indicating group membership, $y$ is the number of users that purchased the
product and $N$ is the total number of users in each group. Below we fit this
model to the data.

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
experiment_bin <- data.frame(group = factor(c("C","D")),
                             y = c(10,14),
                             trials = c(19,22))
fit_group_bin <- stan_glm(cbind(y, trials - y) ~ 0 + group, data = experiment_bin,
                          family = binomial(link="logit"), seed = 123)
```

Similar to the method described in the previous section we compute and plot the
$90\%$ prediction intervals for the posterior predictions in each group. We also
compute the overlap proportion of these two sets of predictions.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# pp_c <- posterior_linpred(fit_group_bin, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("C")), transform = TRUE)
# pp_d <- posterior_linpred(fit_group_bin, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("D")), transform = TRUE)
# below doesn't work as expected (predictions are bigger than the number of trials)
# pp_c <- posterior_predict(fit_group_bin, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("C"), trials = 19))
# pp_d <- posterior_predict(fit_group_bin, newdata = data.frame(group = factor("D"), trials = 22))
pp <- posterior_predict(fit_group_bin)
pp_c <- pp[,1]
pp_d <- pp[,2]
pp_c_quant <- quantile(pp_c, probs = c(0.05,0.95))
pp_d_quant <- quantile(pp_d, probs = c(0.05,0.95))

# compute overlap
overlap(pp_c, pp_d, p = 0.9)

# plot
# group C
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(pp_c, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group C",
     xlab = "Product Consumption",
     xlim = c(0,25))
abline(v = pp_c_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_c_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
# group D
hist(pp_d, breaks = 50, col = '#808080', border = '#FFFFFF',
     main = "Group D",
     xlab = "Product Consumption",
     xlim = c(0,25))
abline(v = pp_d_quant[1], lwd = 2, col = "red")
abline(v = pp_d_quant[2], lwd = 2, col = "red")
```

Looking at the histograms it's clear that there's quite a bit of overlap between
the two groups. The overlap proportion is about 0.7. So under our $90\%$
prediction interval, there is a $70\%$ chance that there is no difference in
behavior when the UI changes. This might suggest that we don't have strong
evidence that the UI change encouraged a change in behavior.

Below we show how the overlap proportion varies based on the amount of risk
we're willing to take when we define our prediction intervals. Similar to the
continuous example in the previous section, risk is inversely related to group
similarity.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
# prediction interval probabilities
ci_p <- rev(seq(0.1,1, by = 0.05))
# compute proportions
overlap_cd <- sapply(ci_p, function(s){overlap(pp_c, pp_d, s)})
# plot
plot(ci_p, overlap_cd, type = "o", pch = 20,
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     main = "Group C vs Group D", xlab = "Prediction Interval Probability (1-Risk)", ylab = "Overlap Proportion (Group Similarity)")
axis(1, seq(0,1,by=0.1), cex.axis = 0.8)
axis(2, seq(0,1,by=0.1), cex.axis = 0.8)
abline(v = 0.5, lty = 2)
```

Note, this example involved a really small data set (only one observation for
each group). But the same model can easily be extended to many observations
within each group. Also, just as we described in the continuous example, we can
define a more comprehensive model for the outcome if we had additional
predictors.

## Benefits of Bayesian Methods

The key benefits that we have discussed include the ability to probabilistically
interpret the results of our inference, and the ability to incorporate prior
beliefs (i.e. business knowledge and hypotheses) into our models.

**Interpretation of probability**

With regards to interpretation, there are some advantages with taking a Bayesian
inference approach to A/B testing using Stan:

1. The ability to communicate our results using the intuitive concept of
probability.
3. The ability to quantify business risk using probability when doing inference.

Quantifying our uncertainty probabilistically enables us to make statements like
"based on the data collected, the model specified, and the risk we are willing
to take; we are 80% certain that the two groups are different." This is much
more interpretable than statements like 'with a p-value of less than 0.2 we can
reject the null hypothesis that the two groups are identical'. While this is not
exclusively a Bayesian benefit (i.e. we could have completely excluded priors
from our models, estimating the parameters solely from the likelihood of the
data), we took advantage of the fact that appropriately implemented Bayesian
computational methods rely on robust sampling methods. These samples can then be
transformed and used to make probabilistic statements about the posterior
predictive distribution, and consequentially about the question being asked.

**Incorporating prior beliefs**

The ability to define a prior distribution on your parameters is a useful
feature of Bayesian methods. Prior information can be incorporated in your model
with two choices: the type of the distribution and how the distribution is
parametrized.

The type of distribution relates to which distribution you choose to define on
the parameters. In the continuous data example we chose the normal distribution.
But, since the underlying data (hours streamed per day) cannot be negative, it
might be more sensible to define a truncated normal distribution as the prior
(which is straightforward to implement in rstan). This gives us the opportunity
to model the data generation process more appropriately.

How the prior distribution is parameterized reflects your belief on the value
that parameter takes. This gives us the opportunity to quantify business
knowledge in prior distributions. In the continuous data example we showed how
we parameterized the prior distribution for each group's parameter to capture
our prior belief that the two groups are similar. A similar approach can be
taken for the treatment group in the count data example.

With these types of priors, if we concluded that the two groups are in fact
different then we could really be sure that the treatment actually changed the
treatment group's behavior. In other words, the treatment group's observed
behavior overcame our prior belief. We could also tune this belief to be more or
less strong by adjusting where most of the density/mass of the prior
distribution sits. Applying this type of prior would help mitigate
false-positive conclusions from this type of analysis.

## Conclusion

Below is an abstracted summary of the inference process we've gone through to
compare groups involved in A/B testing.

1. Model the indicator that is being measured to track the difference between
the two groups.
2. Compute the prediction interval $p$ over the posterior predictions of the two
groups. $1-p$ quantifies how much risk the business is willing to take in
regards to the predicted indicator. The value of $p$ should be driven by
domain-specific experts.
3. Compute the proportion $o$ of how much each interval overlaps with one
another. $o$ defines the similarity between the two groups.

After implementing the steps above, we can construct the following conclusion:
given there is a $(1-p) \cdot 100$ percent chance that we are wrong about the
predictions from our model, there is a $(1-o) \cdot 100$ percent
chance that the two groups are different.

The Bayesian methods outlined in this case study focused on modeling the data
generation process and performing inference on the posterior predictive
distribution of two groups. We did not need to worry about computing test
statistics and determining the distribution of these statistics under the null
hypothesis. Nor did we need to calculate p-values to figure out whether the
groups involved in the A/B test are different. Instead we performed inference
directly on the posterior predictions. By constructing prediction intervals and
computing the overlap of these intervals we are able to probabilistically convey
how sure we are about the difference between the two groups. Bayesian inference
gives statisticians the ability to quantify business information/risk and
enables them to communicate uncertainty unambiguously to decision makers,
allowing more informed decisions to be made.

## Appendix A: Refresher on p-values

Recall that frequentist methods of hypothesis testing involve constructing a
test statistic with the available data. Then, using the distribution of that
test statistic under the null hypothesis, you can determine the probability of
observing statistics that are more extreme than the one calculated. This is
known as a p-value. A small p-value suggests a small probability of observing a
more extreme test statistic, which in turn means that it is unlikely for that
statistic to have been generated under the null hypothesis. Since the statistic
is computed from the data this suggests that the data itself is unlikely to have
been generated under the null hypothesis. The value of how small a p-value
should be to arrive at this conclusion is up to the statistician.

As an example consider the data associated with Group A and Group B in the
continuous data section. The null hypothesis is whether the two groups have
equal means. Below we compute Welch's test statistic and p-value given the data.

```{r}
group_a <- experiment$y[experiment$group == "A"]
group_b <- experiment$y[experiment$group == "B"]
# Relevant dplyr code
# group_a <- experiment %>% filter(group == "A") %>% select(y) %>% unlist %>% unname
# group_b <- experiment %>% filter(group == "B") %>% select(y) %>% unlist %>% unname

t_test <- t.test(x=group_a, y=group_b)
t_stat <- abs(t_test$statistic)
p_value <- t_test$p.value
print(p_value)
# You can manually compute the p-value with the following code
# p_value <- pt(-t_stat, t_test$parameter)*2

# you can manually compute the confidence intervals with the following code
# group_a_mean <- mean(group_a)
# group_b_mean <- mean(group_b)
# v <- sqrt((var(group_a)/length(group_a)) + (var(group_b)/length(group_b)))
# ci_lwr <- (group_a_mean - group_b_new_mean) - abs(qt(0.025, t_test$parameter[['df']])*v)
# ci_upr <- (group_a_mean - group_b_new_mean) + abs(qt(0.025, t_test$parameter[['df']])*v)
```

The p-value in this case is really small, approximately zero. We can visualize
this result. Since we know that the test statistic is t-distributed we can plot
what the distribution of the test statistic under the null, along with the test
statistic calculated with the observed data. This is illustrated below. The red
lines are the (two-tailed) test statistics calculated from the data.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
dof <- t_test$parameter[["df"]]
x <- seq(-10,10,length.out = 1e3)
plot(x, dt(x, dof), type = "l",
     main = "Distribution of Test Statistics Under Null Hypothesis",
     xlab = "t-statistic value",
     ylab = "t-distribution density")
abline(v=-t_stat, col="red", lwd=2)
abline(v=t_stat, col="red", lwd=2)
```

Given the small p-value we can make the following sequence of conclusions:

1. The computed test statistic is unlikely to occur under the null hypothesis.
2. The data used to compute this statistic is unlikely to have been generated
under the null hypothesis.
3. Therefore the null hypothesis must be invalid and can be rejected, allowing
us to conclude that the two groups are different.

Notice how far removed we are from the data and the observed data generation
process. Once we calculate the test statistic we step away from the distribution
of the data itself and start dealing with the distribution of the test statistic
under the null. We were also unable to encode any prior belief or business
knowledge into our inference.

## Appendix B: Hierarchical Example

Here we show how to use hierarchical (or multilevel) models as an alternative modeling approach when performing A/B tests. Using the data in the continuous example we want to build a model where we account for group-level intercepts while allowing information to be shared among the groups.

$$
\begin{align*}
y_{i=A} \sim &\mathcal{N}(\mu_A + \beta \cdot high\_consumer_{i=A}, \sigma) \\
y_{i=B} \sim &\mathcal{N}(\mu_B + \beta \cdot high\_consumer_{i=B}, \sigma) \\
\beta \sim& \mathcal{N}(0,1) \\
& \mbox{(default priors specified on covariance matrix and } \sigma \mbox{)}
\end{align*}
$$

Below we fit the model.

```{r results='hide'}
fit_hier <- stan_glmer(y ~ 0 + (1 | group) + hc,
                       prior = normal(0, 1),
                       data = experiment,
                       family = gaussian(link="identity"),
                       seed = 123)
```

```{r}
coef(fit_hier)
fixef(fit_hier)
ranef(fit_hier)
```

With this modeling approach we can perform the same inferences as we have shown
above while accounting for the hierarchical nature of the data.
