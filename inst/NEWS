Fri July 29 2016 (2.11.1)
1. Bug fixes
  * Requiring manually specifying offsets when model has an offset and newdata is not NULL
2. New features
  * stan_biglm function that somewhat supports biglm::biglm
  * as.array method for stanreg objects

Fri June 24 2016 (2.10.1)
1. Bug fixes
  * Works with devtools now
2. New features
  * k_threshold argument to loo() and kfold() for enhanced model comparison
  * Ability to use sparse X matrices (slowly) for many models

Tue May 24 2016 (2.9.0-4)
1. Serious bug fixes
  * posterior_predict with newdata was wrong for ordinal models
  * stan_lm() was wrong if there was no intercept
  * stan_glmer.fit() would permit models with duplicative group-specific terms but these
    are usually a mistake on the user's part
2. Bug fixes
  * posterior_predict with lme4-style models would fail if there were spaces or colons 
    in the levels of the grouping variables
  * posterior_predict with ordinal models would output an integer matrix instead of a
    character matrix
3. New features
  * pp_validate() function based on the BayesValidate package by Sam Cook
  * posterior_vs_prior() function to visualize the effect of conditioning on the data
  * Works (again) with R versions back to 3.0.2 (untested though)

Sat Feb 13 2016 (2.9.0-3)
1. Serious bug fixes
  * Fix problem with models that had group-specific coefficients, which were mislabled.
    Although the parameters were estimated correctly, users of previous versions of
    rstanarm should run such models again to obtain correct summaries and posterior
    predictions. Thanks to someone named Luke for pointing this problem out on stan-users.
2. Bug fixes
  * Vignettes now view correctly on the CRAN webiste thanks to Yihui Xie
  * Fix problem with models without intercepts thanks to Paul-Christian Buerkner
  * Fix problem with specifying binomial 'size' for posterior_predict using newdata
  * Fix problem with lme4-style formulas that use the same grouping factor multiple times
  * Fix conclusion in rstanarm vignette thanks to someone named Michael
3. Features
  * Group-specific design matrices are kept sparse throughout to reduce memory consumption
  * The log_lik() function now has a newdata argument
  * New vignette on hierarchical partial pooling
