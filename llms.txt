# rstanarm

### Bayesian applied regression modeling (arm) via Stan

This is an R package that emulates other R model-fitting functions but
uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) (via the **rstan** package) for the
back-end estimation. The primary target audience is people who would be
open to Bayesian inference if using Bayesian software were easier but
would use frequentist software otherwise.

Fitting models with **rstanarm** is also useful for experienced Bayesian
software users who want to take advantage the pre-compiled Stan programs
that are written by Stan developers and carefully implemented to
prioritize numerical stability and the avoidance of sampling problems.

More detail

The **rstanarm** package is an appendage to the **rstan** package, the R
interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). **rstanarm** enables many of
the most common applied regression models to be estimated using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo, variational approximations to the posterior
distribution, or optimization. The package allows these models to be
specified using the customary R modeling syntax (e.g., like that of
`glm` with a `formula` and `data.frame`). Additional arguments are
provided for specifying prior distributions.

The set of models supported by **rstanarm** is large (and will continue
to grow), but also limited enough so that it is possible to integrate
them tightly with the
[`pp_check`](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/pp_check.stanreg.html)
function for graphical posterior predictive checks using
[**bayesplot**](https://mc-stan.org/bayesplot) and the
[`posterior_predict`](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/posterior_predict.stanreg.html)
function to easily estimate the effect of specific manipulations of
predictor variables or to predict the outcome in a training set.

The fitted model objects returned by the **rstanarm** modeling functions
are called *stanreg* objects. In addition to all of the traditional
[methods](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stanreg-methods.html)
defined for fitted model objects, stanreg objects can also be used with
the [**loo**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/loo.stanreg.html)
package for leave-one-out cross-validation, model comparison, and model
weighting/averaging and the
[**shinystan**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/shinystan.html)
package for exploring the posterior distribution and model diagnostics
with a graphical user interface.

Check out the **rstanarm**
[vignettes](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/) for examples and
more details about the entire process.

Modeling functions

The model estimating functions are described in greater detail in their
individual help pages and vignettes. Here we provide a very brief
overview:

- [**`stan_lm`**,
  **`stan_aov`**,**`stan_biglm`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_lm.html)

  Similar to `lm` and `aov` but with novel regularizing priors on the
  model parameters that are driven by prior beliefs about R-squared, the
  proportion of variance in the outcome attributable to the predictors
  in a linear model.

- [**`stan_glm`**,
  **`stan_glm.nb`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_glm.html)

  Similar to `glm` but with various possible prior distributions for the
  coefficients and, if applicable, a prior distribution for any
  auxiliary parameter in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that is
  characterized by a `family` object (e.g. the shape parameter in Gamma
  models). It is also possible to estimate a negative binomial model
  similar to the `glm.nb` function in the `MASS` package.

- [**`stan_glmer`**, **`stan_glmer.nb`**,
  **`stan_lmer`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_glmer.html)

  Similar to the `glmer`, `glmer.nb`, and `lmer` functions (**lme4**
  package) in that GLMs are augmented to have group-specific terms that
  deviate from the common coefficients according to a mean-zero
  multivariate normal distribution with a highly-structured but unknown
  covariance matrix (for which **rstanarm** introduces an innovative
  prior distribution). MCMC provides more appropriate estimates of
  uncertainty for models that consist of a mix of common and
  group-specific parameters.

- [**`stan_nlmer`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_nlmer.html)

  Similar to `nlmer` (**lme4** package) package for nonlinear
  “mixed-effects” models, but flexible priors can be specified for all
  parameters in the model, including the unknown covariance matrices for
  the varying (group-specific) coefficients.

- [**`stan_gamm4`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_gamm4.html)

  Similar to `gamm4` (**gamm4** package), which augments a GLM (possibly
  with group-specific terms) with nonlinear smooth functions of the
  predictors to form a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM). Rather
  than calling [`lme4::glmer`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lme4/man/glmer.html)
  like `gamm4` does, `stan_gamm4` essentially calls `stan_glmer`, which
  avoids the optimization issues that often crop up with GAMMs and
  provides better estimates for the uncertainty of the parameter
  estimates.

- [**`stan_polr`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_polr.html)

  Similar to `polr` (**MASS** package) in that it models an ordinal
  response, but the Bayesian model also implies a prior distribution on
  the unknown cutpoints. Can also be used to model binary outcomes,
  possibly while estimating an unknown exponent governing the
  probability of success.

- [**`stan_betareg`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_betareg.html)

  Similar to `betareg` (**betareg** package) in that it models an
  outcome that is a rate (proportion) but, rather than performing
  maximum likelihood estimation, full Bayesian estimation is performed
  by default, with customizable prior distributions for all parameters.

- [**`stan_clogit`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_clogit.html)

  Similar to `clogit` (**survival** package) in that it models an binary
  outcome where the number of successes and failures is fixed within
  each stratum by the research design. There are some minor syntactical
  differences relative to
  [`survival::clogit`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/clogit.html)
  that allow `stan_clogit` to accept group-specific terms as in
  `stan_glmer`.

- [**`stan_mvmer`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_mvmer.html)

  A multivariate form of `stan_glmer`, whereby the user can specify one
  or more submodels each consisting of a GLM with group-specific terms.
  If more than one submodel is specified (i.e. there is more than one
  outcome variable) then a dependence is induced by assuming that the
  group-specific terms for each grouping factor are correlated across
  submodels.

- [**`stan_jm`**](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_jm.html)

  Estimates shared parameter joint models for longitudinal and
  time-to-event (i.e. survival) data. The joint model can be univariate
  (i.e. one longitudinal outcome) or multivariate (i.e. more than one
  longitudinal outcome). A variety of parameterisations are available
  for linking the longitudinal and event processes (i.e. a variety of
  association structures).

Estimation algorithms

The modeling functions in the **rstanarm** package take an `algorithm`
argument that can be one of the following:

- **Sampling** (`algorithm="sampling"`):

Uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) — in particular, Stan’s
implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with a tuned but
diagonal mass matrix — to draw from the posterior distribution of the
parameters. This is the slowest but most reliable of the available
estimation algorithms and it is **the default and recommended algorithm
for statistical inference**.

- **Mean-field** (`algorithm="meanfield"`):

Uses mean-field variational inference to draw from an approximation to
the posterior distribution. In particular, this algorithm finds the set
of independent normal distributions in the unconstrained space that —
when transformed into the constrained space — most closely approximate
the posterior distribution. Then it draws repeatedly from these
independent normal distributions and transforms them into the
constrained space. The entire process is much faster than HMC and yields
independent draws but **is not recommended for final statistical
inference**. It can be useful to narrow the set of candidate models in
large problems, particularly when specifying `QR=TRUE` in `stan_glm`,
`stan_glmer`, and `stan_gamm4`, but is **only an approximation to the
posterior distribution**.

- **Full-rank** (`algorithm="fullrank"`):

Uses full-rank variational inference to draw from an approximation to
the posterior distribution by finding the multivariate normal
distribution in the unconstrained space that — when transformed into the
constrained space — most closely approximates the posterior
distribution. Then it draws repeatedly from this multivariate normal
distribution and transforms the draws into the constrained space. This
process is slower than meanfield variational inference but is faster
than HMC. Although still an approximation to the posterior distribution
and thus **not recommended for final statistical inference**, the
approximation is more realistic than that of mean-field variational
inference because the parameters are not assumed to be independent in
the unconstrained space. Nevertheless, fullrank variational inference is
a more difficult optimization problem and the algorithm is more prone to
non-convergence or convergence to a local optimum.

- **Optimizing** (`algorithm="optimizing"`):

Finds the posterior mode using a C++ implementation of the LBGFS
algorithm. If there is no prior information, then this is equivalent to
maximum likelihood, in which case there is no great reason to use the
functions in the **rstanarm** package over the emulated functions in
other packages. However, if priors are specified, then the estimates are
penalized maximum likelihood estimates, which may have some redeeming
value. Currently, optimization is only supported for `stan_glm`.

### Installation

#### Latest Release

The most recent **rstanarm** release can be installed from CRAN via

``` r
install.packages("rstanarm")
```

#### Development Version

To install from GitHub, first make sure that you can install the
**rstan** package and C++ toolchain by following these
[instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
Once **rstan** is successfully installed, you can install **rstanarm**
from GitHub using the **remotes** package by executing the following in
R:

``` r
# Change 2 to however many cores you can/want to use to parallelize install
# If you experience crashes or run out RAM during installation, try changing this to 1
Sys.setenv(MAKEFLAGS = "-j2")
Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")
remotes::install_github("stan-dev/rstanarm", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch", force = TRUE)
```

You can switch `build_vignettes` to `TRUE` but it takes a lot longer to
install and the vignettes are already separately available from the
[Stan website](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/index.html) and
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstanarm/vignettes). If
installation fails, please let us know by [filing an
issue](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/issues).

#### Survival Analysis Version

The `feature/survival` branch on GitHub contains a development version
of **rstanarm** that includes survival analysis functionality (via the
`stan_surv` modelling function). Until this functionality is available
in the CRAN release of **rstanarm**, users who wish to use the survival
analysis functionality can install a binary version of the survival
branch of **rstanarm** from the Stan R packages repository with:

    install.packages("rstanarm", repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos")))

Note that this binary is static (i.e. it is not automatically updated)
and is only hosted so that users can access the (experimental) survival
analysis functionality without needing to go through the time consuming
(and sometimes painful) task of installing the development version of
**rstanarm** from source.
